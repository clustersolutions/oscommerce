Welcome to osCommerce Online Merchant!

We are ready to share our new foundation with you and are excited to disrupt the
developer community with our future goals. The Countdown website used to promote
v3.0 will remain online to keep the community informed of our actual plans and
roadmap. The Countdown website can be reached at:

http://countdown.oscommerce.com

The v3.0 release focused primarily on freezing the new framework API to start
building onto with the community. v3.0 does not contain a full user feature set
to be able to run an online store on. Now that the framework is frozen, the
missing features will be worked on and pushed through the new CoreUpdate
delivery mechanism that can easily upgrade running installations.

We look forward to working with you in improving and extending osCommerce
Online Merchant!

To install osCommerce Online Merchant v3.0, copy the contents of the release
package to your public html directory. The "osCommerce" directory can be added
to the PHP include directory and be moved outside of the public html directory.

The Setup Site will first load to setup and configure a new installation. Once
installed and configured, the Shop and Admin Sites can be reached with:

http://demo.oscommerce.com/index.php (for Shop)
http://demo.oscommerce.com/index.php?Admin (for Admin)

Please note that the Setup Site is still reachable and should be deleted. This
can be performed by deleting the following directory:

osCommerce/OM/Core/Site/Setup

For customizations, please copy the file with the same directory structure to
the custom namespace located at:

osCommerce/OM/Custom

The Custom directory can mimick the Core directory to override core files with
customizations.
