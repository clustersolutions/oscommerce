Welcome to osCommerce Online Merchant!

We are ready to share our new foundation with you and are excited to disrupt the
developer community with our future goals. The Countdown website used to promote
v3.0 will remain online to keep the community informed of our actual plans and
roadmap. The Countdown website can be reached at:

The v3.0 release focused primarily on freezing the new framework API to start
building onto with the community. v3.0 does not contain a full user feature set
to be able to run an online store on. Now that the framework is frozen, the
missing features will be worked on and pushed through the new CoreUpdate
delivery mechanism that can easily upgrade running installations.

We look forward to working with you in improving and extending osCommerce
